This is the code for the preprint **Widespread variation in molecular interactions and regulatory properties among transcription factor isoforms**

The python version used to produce the figures is listed in `.python-version` (3.8.13). [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can be used to install that specific version. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip -r requirements.txt` after setting up a virtual environment.

The source data files are currently missing. I'll add them soon. The processed data is in `supp/`.
