Notes on the manual annoation.

There were 37 genes for which the original name was not found in gencode30.

Going back to the source lists, I retrieved the ENSG for each genename, searched the internet, and copy/pasted the new genename.

In following script, c_*, checked and all manually added genenames *are* present in gencode30.
