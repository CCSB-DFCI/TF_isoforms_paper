These three genes are in gencode30, but were not processed and didn't make it to the final table d_gen*tsv, because they are pseudogenes with no protein-coding products.

ZNF812P
ZNF788P
ZSCAN5DP

Also, the DUX genes did not make it to the final table, because they reside on acrochromosomes and are not in gencode.
I emailed gencode to make sure (190528).
