Regulatory domains were mapped to 6K isoforms.

I took the regulatory domain sequences and sequence-aligned to all the 6K ORFs.

This analysis was done by defining an anchor domain, which is the domain as mapped to the longest 6K ORF.
Then, the anchor domain is propogated to all the ORFs of the TF gene, and from the aln object, I make calls in terms of which AAs are affected.
