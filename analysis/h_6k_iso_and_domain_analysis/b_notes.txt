Need to update the functions that load orf sequences and make gene objects to accept the old accession info.

That is, if b_* needs to be rerun.


How DBDs were mapped to 6K:

Started with Sachi HMMER alignment of DBDs to GENCODE. Took the DBD-ORF alignment for the APPRIS ORF.

Then, tranferred the DBD-appris_orf mapping to all the 6K ORF mappings.
